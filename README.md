## Details
May 31st, 2022  
Time: 1pm - 2:50pm

## Description

Collecting, storing, and sharing data that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) is an important challenge across microbiome fields. 
In this workshop hosted by the [National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC)](https://microbiomedata.org/), participants will learn about metadata standards, how to plan data collection in their own projects to adhere to these standards, how to share their data with the community, and how to find and use publicly available microbiome data.
